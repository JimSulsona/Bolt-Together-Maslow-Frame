This design is intended to use imperial hardware, but I am certain that similar materials are available in metric sizes. None of the material sizes or bolt sizes are critical. To build this design you will need:

* 3x 10' 2x4s

* 2x 8'  2x4s

* 2x 4'x8' sheets of 3/4 Plywood (Note, you can get away with one sheet if you don't mind having the sled and a few other parts cut out of the back of the machine)

* 2x bricks

* 2x 3/8" by 10" hex bolts with 1 nut and 2 washers each (available at Lowes, not stocked at Home Depot)

* 2x 1/4" by 5" carriage bolts with 1 nut and 1 washer each

* 4x 1/4" by 3.5" carriage bolts with 1 nut and 1 washer each
